  "free": "As a long-lasting IT and Computer Science enthusiast, driven by my autodidactic learning skill, I strive to gain knowledge in various technical-related fields and love to apply it to nowaday's problems. I thrive working closely with others sharing a common goal and learn from everday challenges by self-reflection. I do not define my programming skills by the amount of mastered languages or comprehended frameworks, but by my capability and compulsion to interconnect them based on their individual assets and drawbacks. My day-to-day attitude to problems and challenges is: When you do it, you do it right",
